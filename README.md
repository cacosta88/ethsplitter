# ETHSplitter (Draft)

ETHSplitter is a preliminary draft of an Ethereum smart contract created for research purposes only. The contract is designed to split Ether among multiple recipients in a single transaction, leveraging the Solidity programming language and incorporating OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` contract to manage contract ownership. Please note that this is an initial draft and should not be used in production without thorough testing and review.
